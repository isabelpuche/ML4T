<br>

**Table of Contents**.<br>

The project takes a five-step approach:
<ol>
    <li>Data mining to identify patterns, extract features and generate insights</li>
    <ul>
    	<li>information theory (alpha factors)</li>
    	<li>unsupervised learning</li>
    	<li>model transparency (SHAP)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Supervised learning to generate risk factors or alphas and create trade ideas</li>
    <ul>
    	<li>ML algorithms</li>
    	<li>target specific risk factors</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Allocation of assets according to risk profiles learned by an algorithm</li>
    <li>Testing and evaluation of strategies, incl. through the use of synthetic data</li>
    <li>Interactive, automated refinement of a strategy using RL</li>
</ol><br>
